\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Try reinforcement learning instead
    \item Try a different type of embedding?
    \item Gather data from other function merging heuristics as well
    \item Take into account the profitability of merging: Merged Size < F1 Size + F2 Size
\end{itemize}
