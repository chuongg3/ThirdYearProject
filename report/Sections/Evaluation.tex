\chapter{Evaluation}
Two methods of evaluation for now
\begin{itemize}
    \item MSE of the predicted error
    \item Is the function with the highest alignment score the same as the true value?
    \item Graphing the predicted alignment score vs the true score, ideally data should be staying along the axis
\end{itemize}
